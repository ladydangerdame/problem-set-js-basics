  Create the "Bottles of beer on the wall" song (watch out for infinite loops!):

  ```
      5 bottles of beer on the wall,
      5 bottles of beer!
      Take one down and pass it around,
      4 bottles of beer on the wall...

      4 bottles of beer on the wall,
      4 bottles of beer!
      Take one down and pass it around,
      3 bottles of beer on the wall...
      etc.
  ```

  Bonuses
  - How would you change "0" to "No more"?
  - How would you fix "1 bottles of beer"?
